Recently, I've been doing this **"Keeping up with @DailyCssDesign"** exercises to sharpen my CSS animation and Canvas skills. I saw [the original @DailyCssDesign project](https://dailycssdesign.com/) a few weeks ago, and was marveled by it. Then I thought, "hey, why don't I just implement them again myself, so that I can have a better understanding of how these fancy modern webpages are created?" So, BANG! There it is!

An showcase of under-water effect, the most cutting-edge web animation among most fabulous websites, with **PIXI.js**. It also has a with **GSAP** (TweenMax and TimelineMax). [Live site](http://andiechu.com/showcases/liquid-distortion-effect-with-pixi-js/)

There are also other kinds of frontend exercises I did, from svg animation to webGL. If you want to know more about what I did, please go to [my Codepen Page](https://codepen.io/cad0420)
