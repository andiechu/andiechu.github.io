This is just some small exercise I do every week (or so) to practice my algorithmic art skill.

The works wrote mainly in **Processing** or **C++ with openFrameworks**, but there may also be some Python works too.

I won't be updating them very often here. The most recent works will be seen on my Instagram page.
